# ðŸšŒ NYC Transportation Bus Delay Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
As a **Data Analyst**, I was tasked by the **New York Division of Transportation** with analyzing bus transportation data to improve the efficiency and reliability of the city's transit system. The city has been experiencing a significant number of bus delays and breakdowns, causing inconvenience to commuters and straining public transportation resources. This project focuses on identifying patterns and factors contributing to these delays and providing actionable insights to optimize operations.
